Happy Vertical People Transporter - http://hackaday.io/project/539-Happy-Vertical-People-Transporter

Douglas Adams (in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) envisioned a Happy Vertical People Transporter as opposed to the every day elevators. These HVPT make use of Defocused Temporal Perception to know when a passenger will require transport even before the passenger knows it. 
We can't give Defocused Temporal Perception to our HVPT, but I can give Defocused Computer Perception.

This repo will contain all design files and code needed to create your own HVPT.

Currently the code is licenced under GPLv3. If you do however understand legal speak better than I do and have a reason to suggest another licence, please let me know. Keep in mind the licence must be compatible with: Arduino, Python, OpenCV. The FreeCAD and Fritzing designs are licenced under Creative Commons as BY-SA.
